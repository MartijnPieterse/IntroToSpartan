Steps to follow in the ISE:

1. New Project
2. Add source: Example12.3.vhd
3. Add source: Example12.3.ucf
4. Add source: tb_Example12.3.vhd
   Make sure that the association is set to "simulation".
5. Select "Simulation".
6. Select "tb_Example12.3 - behavior"
7. Expand "ISim Simulator"
8. Double click on "Simulate Behavioral Model"


I added this because i select "uut - BinaryUpCounter" before running the simulation
which just does not give the expected output.
