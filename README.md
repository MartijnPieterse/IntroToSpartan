IntroToSpartan
==============

All examples, project and challenges from IntroToSpartanFPGABook

These are all working for the Papilio Pro.

I have made these while learning FPGA programming/designing. They
may be bad, or good, I don't know. Maybe you can learn something
from it or have a good laugh, both will be acceptable. :-)

How to use
==========

What i do is create a new project in ISE in one of the directories
in this archive. This way the actual source directoty is kept clear
of temporary files generated by the Xilinx tool.

The .bit file will also be generated in the project directory.

TODO
====

Somehow put all the build commands in a makefile. But this might
not be feasible. Don't know.
